We show that the signature genes include many known and novel PKD-related genes and functions. Moreover, genes with a role in injury repair, as evidenced by expression data and/or automated literature analysis, were significantly enriched in the PKD Signature, with 35% of the PKD Signature genes being directly implicated in injury repair.' \
